🤖 Chatbot using NLP & Streamlit

An interactive AI-powered chatbot built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Logistic Regression, wrapped in a clean Streamlit web interface. The chatbot learns from predefined intents and generates contextual responses. It also keeps a conversation history for review.

🚀 Features

🧠 Intent Recognition using TfidfVectorizer + Logistic Regression

💬 Interactive Chat UI powered by Streamlit

🗂 Conversation History stored in chat_log.csv

📑 Multi-page Sidebar → Home | Conversation History | About

🔄 Randomized Responses for natural feel

📚 Custom Intents Support (via intents.json)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NLTK → Tokenization & Text Processing

scikit-learn → Machine Learning (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF)

Streamlit → Web-based chatbot interface

CSV → Conversation logging

⚡ Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-nlp.git
cd chatbot-nlp

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


requirements.txt should include:

streamlit
scikit-learn
nltk

3️⃣ Run the App
streamlit run chatbot.py

📊 How It Works

Intents Dataset (intents.json) contains patterns & responses.

TF-IDF Vectorizer converts text into numerical features.

Logistic Regression Model predicts the user’s intent.

Chatbot Function picks a suitable response at random.

Streamlit UI provides real-time interaction & saves history.

🔮 Future Improvements

🤝 Integrate with APIs for real-time data

🧑‍🏫 Use Deep Learning models (RNN, Transformers) for advanced NLP

🌍 Multi-language support

🎨 Improved UI with custom themes
